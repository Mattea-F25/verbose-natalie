		<p>Bio: Welcome Wendy! You can always find her out on the basketball court (she won the MVP award last year) or in the science lab, since chemistry is her favorite subject. She wants to be a famous scientist when she grows up and likes to paint pictures of her inventions.
<br>
<br>
She's an all around green gal, and is also very eco-friendly, always doing her part to clean up her community. Her favorite food is sushi, especially the avocado rolls and one of her other favorite hobbies includes gardening with her family!
